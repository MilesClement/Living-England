# Living-England
Satellite-based habitat mapping of England in R.


The main R file that you need to run the application is livingEngland_classification.r, you will need to provide paths to your datasets within the R script. 

livingEngland_classification.r requires the user_producer_accuracy.R and zonal_stats_velox.R scripts to run correctly.

Please let us know if you are using the scripts - drop us a line at earth.observation@naturalengland.org.uk
